//! Text Properties
//!
//! Text properties are properties that can be optionally added to text to give them special meaning.
//!
//! The real power behind text properties is that they move with the text, regardless of position.
//!
//! Text properties do not have persistence outside of Vim. Once your instance closes, the text properties are removed as well.
